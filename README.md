## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to create a complete page without watching a tutorial which makes it much harder. However, harder didn't mean I wanted to give up. In the contrary, I just wanted to make it work so I just kept on trying until it worked!

### Continued development

This project showed me that I can actually make it work by myself, without watching a tutorial. Of course, I still have a huge amount of stuff to learn. Therefore, I will continue learning CSS deeper in order to apply it better than I did because I'm pretty sure there is some unnecessary code in my project.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - Helps me a lot when using flexbox.
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - My go to when coding.
